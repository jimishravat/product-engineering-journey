90-day public journey to transition from a service-based role to a product-based software engineering position. Includes DSA, Low-Level Design, System Design, and real-world engineering notes.


# Product Engineering Journey

This repository documents my 90-day public journey to transition from a service-based role at TCS to a product-based software engineering position.

## Focus Areas
- Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)
- Low-Level Design (LLD)
- System Design
- Real-world engineering trade-offs

## Repository Structure
- `/dsa` – Problem-solving with explanations and complexity analysis
- `/lld` – Object-oriented design, SOLID principles, and case studies
- `/system-design` – Scalable system design fundamentals and designs
- `/journey` – Weekly learning logs and reflections

## Learning Principles
- Consistency over intensity
- Clarity over cleverness
- Interview readiness with production context

## Verification
All progress is backed by GitHub commits and weekly updates.
